These examples will highlight the fundamental importance of observations in any scientific inquiry. 2 The underlying criterion, such as morphological, biochemical or ecological be highlighted. Hierarchy of life forms at phenomenological level. A common thread weaves this hierarchy Classification. Discuss classification based on  a  cellularity  Unicellular or multicellular  b  ultrastructure  prokaryotes or eucaryotes.  c  energy and Carbon utilisation  Autotrophs, heterotrophs, lithotropes  d  Ammonia excretion – aminotelic, uricoteliec, ureotelic  e  Habitata  acquatic or terrestrial  e  Molecular taxonomy  three major kingdoms of life. A given organism can come under different category based on classification. Model organisms for the study of biology come from different groups. E.coli, S.cerevisiae, D. Melanogaster, C. elegance, A. Thaliana, M. musculus 3 3 To convey that “Genetics is to biology what Newton’s lawsaretoPhysicalSciences”Mendel’s laws, Concept of segregation and independent assortment. Concept of allele. Gene mapping, Gene interaction, Epistasis. Meiosis and Mitosis be taught as a part of genetics. Emphasis to be give not to the mechanics of cell division nor the phases but how genetic material passes from parent to offspring. Concepts of recessiveness and dominance. Concept of mapping of phenotype to genes. Discuss about the single gene disorders in humans. Discuss the concept of complementation using human genetics. 4 4 Biomolecules  To convey that all forms of life have the same building blocks and yet the manifestations are as diverse as one can imagine Molecules of life. In this context discuss monomeric units and polymeric structures. Discuss about sugars, starch and cellulose. Amino acids and proteins. Nucleotides and DNA RNA.Two carbon units and lipids 4 5 Enzymes  To convey that without catalysis life would not have existed on earth Enzymology  How to monitor enzyme catalysed reactions. How does an enzyme catalyse reactions  Enzyme classification. Mechanism of enzyme action. Discuss at least two examples. Enzyme kinetics and kinetic parameters. Why should we know these parameters to understand biology  RNA catalysis. 4 6 Information Transfer The molecular basis of coding and decoding genetic information is universal Molecular basis of information transfer. DNA as a genetic material. Hierarchy of DNA structure  from single stranded to double helix to nucleosomes. Concept of genetic code. Universality and degeneracy of genetic code.

Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering Effective from Academic Session 2023 24 Page 1   81 P23  Mapping of Course Outcomes with Program Outcomes PROGRAM OUTCOME  POs  Engineering Graduates will be able to  1. Engineering Knowledge  Apply the knowledge of mathematics, science, engineering fundamentals, and an engineering specialization to the solution of complex engineering problems. 2. Problem analysis  Identify, formulate, research literature, and analyse complex engineering problems reaching substantiated conclusions using first principles of mathematics, natural sciences, and engineering sciences. 3. Design development of solutions  Design solutions for complex engineering problems and design system components or processes that meet the specified needs with appropriate consideration for the public health and safety, and the cultural, societal, and environmental considerations. 4. Conduct investigations of complex problems  Use research based knowledge and research methods including design of experiments, analysis and interpretation of data, and synthesis of the information to provide valid conclusions. 5. Modern Tool Usage  Create, select, and apply appropriate techniques, resources, and modern engineering and IT tools including prediction and modeling to complex engineering activities with an understanding of the limitations. 6. The Engineer and Society  Apply reasoning informed by the contextual knowledge to assess societal, health, safety, legal, and cultural issues and the consequent responsibilities relevant to the professional engineering practice. 7. Environment and Sustainability  Understand the impact of the professional engineering solutions in societal and environmental contexts, and demonstrate the knowledge of need for sustainable development. 8. Ethics  Apply ethical principles and commit to professional ethics and responsibilities and norms of the engineering practice. 9. Individual and Team Work  Function effectively as an individual, and as a member or leader in diverse teams, and in multidisciplinary settings. 10. Communication  Communicate effectively on complex engineering activities with the engineering community and with society at large, such as, being able to comprehend andwrite effective reports and design documentation, make effective presentations, and giveand receive clear instructions. 11. Project Management and Finance  Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the engineering and management principles and apply these to one’s own work, as a member and leader in a team, to manage projects and in multidisciplinary environments. 12. Life long learning  Recognize the need for, and have the preparation and ability to engage in independent and life long learning in the broadest context of technological change.
