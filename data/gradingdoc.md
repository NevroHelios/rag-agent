Bonus Marks
-----------

Course Participation Marks are for encouraging and incentivizing students to participate more in the course activities.

These marks will be added ONLY for students who pass the course and will only impact the course grade, not the pass criteria.

### Criteria for course participation marks:

Marks will be applicable based on availability of mock activities in the course. It can vary from course to course and range from 0-2.

* If the average of the marks obtained in all the mock tests conducted before Quiz 1 & Quiz 2 >= 40/100, students will get 2 marks. The mock tests must be done within the specified time.
* The course team may set up additional activities eligible for up to 3 bonus marks. If no additional activities are set up, this bonus won't be applicable.

### Participation in the discourse forum: Badges

We will be looking at active engagement with Discourse in a term and provide badges for participation.

Badges will be given based on the number of hours a student spends on Discourse. A student is expected to spend a minimum of 1 hour per week per course in Discourse reading posts.

Information about course grades:
--------------------------------

S, A, B, C, D, E - Pass grade; U/WA/WQ - Fail grade; I - Incomplete

In I grade - there are 3 types:

a. If you are absent for ET alone with all other assessment components completed (quizzes, OPPEs, project, weekly assignments) - grade will be pushed as I.

* Options: You can register to take up ET exam alone in the subsequent term. OPPE and quizzes will not be scheduled for you. All other marks for Final course score will be taken from the previous run.

b. If you have failed in the OPPE but wrote the ET exam and crossed the cutoff for T as given in the course grading policy, grade = I_OP.

* You can register to do the OPPE alone whereby if the course has one OPPE, that will be scheduled. If the course has 2 OPPEs, both will be scheduled for you. You can attempt the OPPE alone. All other mark components of Final course score will be taken from the previous run. ET and quizzes will not be scheduled for you.

c. If you have failed in the OPPE and absent for ET, then grade = I_BOTH

* You can register to ET and OPPEs alone. If the course has one OPPE, that will be scheduled. If the course has 2 OPPEs, both will be scheduled for you. You will attempt the ET and OPPEs. Quiz and GAA and other components will be taken from the previous run and not scheduled.

In all the above cases, you can also choose to Repeat the entire course and not just do the ET/OPPE alone if you want to reattempt all assessment components.

Diploma Level courses
---------------------

### Suggested pathway to register and study Diploma level courses:

1. Most aggressive pathway - completing in 4 terms - ONLY IF YOU ARE DOING THIS AS FULL TIME AND NOTHING ELSE AND CAN SPEND 70 HRs PER WEEK MINIMUM
2. Comfortable pathway - 6 terms - 2 years: Suggested for students and working professionals doing this along with another degree or their job (40hrs/week)
3. Those from non technical backgrounds, new to programming or have busy schedules, recommended to take 6 or 7 terms for the 2 diplomas.
4. Same sequence of courses are suggested if you are taking only the Diploma in programming or Diploma in DS separately too.

Maximum number of terms to complete both Diplomas: 12

Even with a relaxed pathway, you should complete in a maximum of 7 or 8 terms.

For MLT, MLF is a co-requisite. For MLP, MLT is a pre-req.For App dev 1 proj, App dev 1 Th is coreq.For App dev 2 Theory, App dev 1 proj is a co-req.

**Pathway options:**

| Duration | Term 1                                    | Term 2                                              | Term 3                                      | Term 4                              | Term 5                                | Term 6               | Term 7            |

The new rules for those entering Diploma Level from May 2024 onwards:

* Complete minimum of 3 courses and 1 project in every 3 terms, which means:
  * The slowest you can go is 3 courses and 1 project in 3 terms (1 year), 6 courses and 2 projects in 6 terms (2 years), 9 courses and 3 projects in 9 terms (3 years) and 12 courses and 4 projects in 12 terms (4 years).
* At the end of 3 terms, if you do not complete 3 courses and 1 project you will be given warning. At the end of 6/9/12 terms if you do not complete 6/9/12 courses and 2/3/4 projects, you will be removed from the program.

If you wish to do the Diploma in programming and Diploma in data science one after the other and not mix up the courses, here are the suggested pathways:

**Diploma in Programming separately:**

**Timelines (Appdev1, Appdev2 & MLP, BDM projects):**

Here are the timelines for students doing projects in the January 2025 terms who will be entering Degree level in the Jan 2025 term. Without completing the 12 courses and 4 projects, you cannot start degree level courses from Jan 2025 onwards.

For entering the Degree level in May 2025, you have to complete ALL projects and vivas by March 2025.

BDM project final submission has to be done and approved by Feb/March 2025 so that viva can be over in March/April 2025.Project grade for all the courses will be pushed on/before April 20th.

Very important:Viva policiesViva planner - Jan 2025 term-MLPViva planner - Jan 2025 - Appdev

Students who completed App dev1, App dev2, MLP and BDM in Sep 2021/Jan 2022 terms:If you complete the 6 courses and 2 projects of any of the two Diploma, you will get the Diploma certificates. But your credits will not be 27 for this Diploma but 23 or 25 depending on how many of these courses were completed in these 2 terms. The projects done as part of the courses of Sep 2021/Jan 2022 will not get the 2 credits. So there is no issue with the Diploma level.

When you come to the BSc level, 114 credits are required to obtain the BSc certificate. Hence this deficit of 2/4/6/8 credits will have to be made up by taking more elective courses offered by the IITM BS program.
Degree Level courses
--------------------

Level of the course:The first digit of the 4 digits given in the course code represents the level of the course. Eg: CT is CS1001 is a 1 level course.Deep Learning CS3004 is a 3 level course.Industry 4.0 MS4001 is a 4 level course.

BSc level:It is now mandatory that students have to complete both the core pairs and SPG in the BSc level. Credits = 20All 8 credits can be earned from IITM BS courses or NPTEL (maximum upto 4 credits from Table 2) or if there is an option to credit campus courses (IITM or other institutes), that too can be done.This will be implemented wef Sep 2023 for the batch that enters the degree level in Sep 2023.

BS level:2 courses in the level 4 or higher should be mandatorily completed in each of the BP and BD categories. Please refer course category in table1Out of the remaining 12 credits, it is MANDATORY to earn 4 credits in the HS/MG category. HS/MG can come from inhouse electives or from NPTEL-Table 3.Remaining credits are from any of the other in-house/campus electives or Apprenticeship electives.

Apprenticeship:Apprenticeship is completely optional. Students can also complete the BS level by just doing only course work.
