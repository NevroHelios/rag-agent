Engineering Knowledge  Apply the knowledge of mathematics, science, engineering fundamentals, and an engineering specialization to the solution of complex engineering problems. 2. Problem analysis  Identify, formulate, research literature, and analyse complex engineering problems reaching substantiated conclusions using first principles of mathematics, natural sciences, and engineering sciences. 3. Design development of solutions  Design solutions for complex engineering problems and design system components or processes that meet the specified needs with appropriate consideration for the public health and safety, and the cultural, societal, and environmental considerations. 4. Conduct investigations of complex problems  Use research based knowledge and research methods including design of experiments, analysis and interpretation of data, and synthesis of the information to provide valid conclusions. 5. Modern Tool Usage  Create, select, and apply appropriate techniques, resources, and modern engineering and IT tools including prediction and modeling to complex engineering activities with an understanding of the limitations. 6. The Engineer and Society  Apply reasoning informed by the contextual knowledge to assess societal, health, safety, legal, and cultural issues and the consequent responsibilities relevant to the professional engineering practice. 7. Environment and Sustainability  Understand the impact of the professional engineering solutions in societal and environmental contexts, and demonstrate the knowledge of need for sustainable development. 8. Ethics  Apply ethical principles and commit to professional ethics and responsibilities and norms of the engineering practice. 9. Individual and Team Work  Function effectively as an individual, and as a member or leader in diverse teams, and in multidisciplinary settings. 10. Communication  Communicate effectively on complex engineering activities with the engineering community and with society at large, such as, being able to comprehend andwrite effective reports and design documentation, make effective presentations, and giveand receive clear instructions. 11. Project Management and Finance  Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the engineering and management principles and apply these to one’s own work, as a member and leader in a team, to manage projects and in multidisciplinary environments. 12. Life long learning  Recognize the need for, and have the preparation and ability to engage in independent and life long learning in the broadest context of technological change.
